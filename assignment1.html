What is a software developer?
A software developer is a professional who has the creative and technical skills to create software programs. The software they develop allows users to perform certain tasks on a computer device, such as playing a game or entering information into a database.

Software developers spend most of their days developing and testing software until it meets a client's needs. They may work in a team or on their own, from home or in an office.

Besides creating the software products, software developers will also upgrade existing applications, perform quality assurance on software and create technical documentation for software systems.
